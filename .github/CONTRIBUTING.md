# Contributing Palettes

Contributions via pull requests are welcome! I would love to have as many video
games represented as possible. With that said, there are two requirements I ask
of any contributed palettes: 

1. The palette must be at least somewhat distinctive. There are many popular and
   beloved games, but if the palette suggestion does not evoke the video game
   that inspired it, it probably should not be contributed. 
2. Please avoid trademarked names for palette names. I am not entirely sure how
   far the [CRAN policy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html)
   extends when it comes to trademarked names but I would rather not risk
   running afoul of CRAN policy.

## Adding the Palette to the List

Adding a new palette is as simple adding a new element to the `gameR_colors`
list in [R/discrete.R](https://github.com/nathansam/gameR/blob/main/R/discrete.R),
adding the name of the palette to `@param palette`, and calling
`devtools::document()` from R to update the package documentation. This package
uses the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org) enforced by
[the styler package](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/).
Before committing your code, try to remember to call  `styler::style_pkg()`.
Do not worry if you forget though! When you open a pull request, a bot should
try to run both `devtools::document()` and `styler::style_pkg()` on your code
anyway.

## Updating the README

The readme is generated by [README.Rmd](https://github.com/nathansam/gameR/blob/main/README.Rmd).
Please update this file with the palettes you are contributing (the palettes are
in alphabetical order) and knit the file before committing and pushing your
contributions.

## Credit

If you are contributing palette(s), I would love for your contribution to be
recognised. Please feel free to add yourself as a contributor (role = "ctb") in
the [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION) file.
