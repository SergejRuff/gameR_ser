# Contributing Palettes

Contributions via pull requests are welcome! I would love to have as many video games represented as possible. With that said, there are two requirements I ask of any contributed palettes: 

1. The palette must be at least somewhat distinctive. There are many popular and beloved games, but if the palette suggestion does evoke the video game that inspired it, it probably should not be contributed. 
2. Please avoid trademarked names for palette names. I am not entirely sure how far the [CRAN policy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) extends when it comes to trademarked names but I would rather not risk running afoul of CRAN policy.

### Adding the Palette to the List

Adding a new palette is as simple adding a new element to the `gameR_colors` list in [R/discrete.R](R/discrete.R), adding the name of the palette to `@param palette`, and calling `devtools::document()` from R to update the package documentation. 

### Updating the README

The readme is generated by [README.Rmd](README.Rmd). Please update this file with the palettes you are contributing (the palettes are in alphabetical order) and knit the file before committing and pushing your contributions.

### Credit

If you are contributing palette(s), I would love for your contribution to be recognised. Please feel free to add yourself as contributor (role = "ctb") in the [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION) file.
